            From Fine Arts to Artificial Intelligence — a journey of creative problem-solving.

    <main class="article-content">
        <h2>The Journey</h2>
        <p>
            My path to AI research wasn't linear — it started with a paintbrush, not a keyboard. I earned my 
            <strong>Bachelor of Fine Arts</strong> from Mississippi State University in 2011, spending years 
            immersed in visual design, illustration, and the principles of communicating complex ideas through imagery.
        </p>
        <p>
            That foundation in visual thinking and creative problem-solving became unexpectedly valuable when I 
            transitioned into technology. What began as freelance web development evolved into a deep fascination 
            with how humans interact with machines — and eventually, how machines can learn from humans.
        </p>
        <p>
            I returned to Mississippi State to pursue computer science, earning my <strong>Master's degree</strong> 
            in 2018 and my <strong>Ph.D.</strong> in 2023, both with a 4.0 GPA. My research focused on 
            IDE-based learning analytics, programming metacognition, and using machine learning to understand 
            how novice programmers think and learn.
        </p>

        <h2>Research & Industry</h2>
        <p>
            Along the way, I've had the privilege of working at some remarkable places:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sandia National Laboratories</strong> — Developed neural network architectures for language generation and NLP applications</li>
            <li><strong>Air Force Research Laboratory</strong> — Built attention-based neural machine translation systems using deep learning</li>
            <li><strong>Mississippi State University</strong> — Led AI research in autonomous manufacturing, generative design, and digital twins</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I've taught over 200 students in ECE Capstone Design, established partnerships between academia and industry, 
            and published research on machine learning for programming education that earned a Best Presentation Award at ASEE.
        </p>

        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            I believe technology should empower people, not replace them. My work sits at the intersection of 
            <strong>human-centered AI</strong> and <strong>resilient systems</strong> — building tools that augment 
            human capabilities while remaining accessible, understandable, and under user control.
        </p>
        <p>
            The solarpunk aesthetic of this site isn't just visual — it reflects a genuine commitment to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Privacy-first design:</strong> Your data should stay yours</li>
            <li><strong>Offline capability:</strong> Technology that works without constant connectivity</li>
            <li><strong>Community empowerment:</strong> Teaching others to build, not just consume</li>
            <li><strong>Sustainable computing:</strong> Efficient, low-power solutions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Current Focus</h2>
        <p>
            Today, I'm focused on:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Building <strong>offline-first AI systems</strong> that run locally without cloud dependencies</li>
            <li>Developing <strong>RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)</strong> pipelines for private document Q&A</li>
            <li>Teaching <strong>workshops</strong> on prompt engineering, AI tools, and vibecoding</li>
            <li>Creating <strong>tutorials</strong> for resilient, self-hosted technology</li>
            <li>Exploring the intersection of <strong>LLMs and education</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Beyond the Screen</h2>
        <p>
            When I'm not coding or researching, you might find me exploring off-grid technology, 
            experimenting with mesh networks, or thinking about how communities can build resilient 
            infrastructure that doesn't depend on big tech.
        </p>
        <p>
            The name "Apollo" in my projects isn't accidental — it represents that same spirit of 
            ambitious, collaborative problem-solving that put humans on the moon. We can build 
            remarkable things when we work together.
        </p>

            <div class="info-box-title">✦ Fun Fact</div>
            <p>
                My BFA background still influences my work — I believe good interfaces are a form of visual 
                communication, and that the best technical documentation is designed, not just written.

        <h2>Connect</h2>
        <p>
            I'm always interested in conversations about AI, education, resilient technology, or creative 
            applications of machine learning. Feel free to reach out:
